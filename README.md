# What Is a Blog & Why Should You Create One

Even if you're _not sure_ what a blog is, you've no doubt come across one at some point in time. Perhaps you've stumbled across a blog when you've searched "healthy dinner recipes". 
Alternatively, maybe you used a blog to get more information on SEO strategies.
In fact, if you're reading this, guess what? You're on a blog. (Very meta, I know.)

If your business doesn't have a blog, you might want to reconsider — B2B marketers who use blogs receive 67% more leads than those who do not, and blogs have been rated the 5th most trusted source for accurate online information. 
At its most basic, blogs can help you develop an online presence, prove yourself an expert in an industry, and attract more quality leads to all pages of your site.

If you're contemplating creating a blog for your business, or simply want to know what one is, keep reading.

## What is a blog?

First, let's go over a brief history -- in 1994, Swarthmore College student Justin Hall is credited with the creation of the first blog, Links.net. At the time, however, it wasn't considered a blog … just a personal homepage.

In 1997, **Jorn Barger**, blogger for Robot Wisdom, coined the term "weblog", which was meant to describe his process for "logging the web" as he surfed the internet. The term "weblog" was shortened to "blog" in 1999, by programmer Peter Merholz.

[Jorn's blogging](#what-is-a-blog) technique is as follows:

1. Choose your target audience.
1. Brainstorm content ideas frequently based on your market segment.
1. Research and review a content management system (CMS).
1. Create a blog strategy and editorial calendar.
1. Pay attention to article structure.
1. Become an expert in marketing and promoting your blog.
1. Learn about SEO.
1. Use a variety of blog post styles.

In the early stages, a blog was a personal web log or journal in which someone could share information or their opinion on a variety of topics. The information was posted reverse chronologically, so the most recent post would appear first.

### What is a blog post?

A blog post is an individual web page on your website that dives into a particular sub-topic of your blog. For instance, let's say you start a fashion blog on your retail website. One blog post might be titled, "The Best Fall Shoes for 2019". The post ties back to your overall blog topic as a whole (fashion), but it also addresses a very particular sub-topic (fall shoes).

Blog posts allow you to rank on search engines for a variety of keywords. In the above example, your blog post could enable your business to rank on Google for "fall shoes". When someone searches for fall shoes and comes across your blog post, they have access to the rest of your company's website. They might click "Products" after they read your post, and take a look at the clothing items your company sells.

## Blog vs. Website

A blog is typically a section of your business's website -- but, unlike the rest of your website, you need to update the blog section frequently by adding new posts. Additionally, your blog is a tool that allows you to engage more with an audience, either by analyzing how many readers share your blog posts on social, or by allowing readers to comment on your individual posts. In this way, a blog is more like a two-way conversation than the rest of your website. However, a blog can also be an entire website, and often is, if the blog is for personal use alone -- for instance, a travel blog.
